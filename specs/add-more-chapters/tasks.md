# Tasks: Add 2 More Chapters to Reach 5 Total Chapters

## Feature Overview
Add 2 new chapters to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook to expand from 3 to 5 chapters. The new chapters will cover Manipulation Systems and Human-Robot Interaction, continuing the logical progression from introduction to foundations to locomotion.

## Dependencies
- Existing textbook structure (Docusaurus documentation setup)
- Current 3 chapters: introduction, foundations, locomotion

## Phase 1: Setup Tasks
- [ ] T001 Create directory for new chapter specification documents
- [ ] T002 Set up content directories if needed

## Phase 2: Foundational Tasks
- [ ] T003 Analyze existing chapter structure and format
- [ ] T004 Define topics for 2 new chapters: Manipulation Systems and Human-Robot Interaction

## Phase 3: [US1] Manipulation Systems Chapter
**User Story Goal:** Create a comprehensive chapter on manipulation systems in humanoid robots that follows the same format and style as existing chapters.

**Independent Test Criteria:** 
- New chapter is accessible through the documentation site
- Chapter follows the same markdown format with frontmatter
- Sidebar includes the new chapter
- Chapter content is technically accurate and comprehensive

**Tasks:**
- [ ] T005 [US1] Create manipulation.md file with proper frontmatter following existing template
- [ ] T006 [US1] Write introduction section for manipulation systems chapter
- [ ] T007 [US1] Write content on kinematics and inverse kinematics for manipulation
- [ ] T008 [US1] Write content on grasping and manipulation strategies
- [ ] T009 [US1] Write about end effectors and hand design
- [ ] T100 [US1] Include practical implementation examples with code
- [ ] T101 [US1] Write about challenges and solutions in manipulation
- [ ] T102 [US1] Add case studies of humanoid manipulation systems
- [ ] T103 [US1] Include exercises and summary sections
- [ ] T104 [US1] Update sidebars.js to include the new chapter with appropriate categorization

## Phase 4: [US2] Human-Robot Interaction Chapter
**User Story Goal:** Create a comprehensive chapter on human-robot interaction and social robotics that follows the same format and style as existing chapters.

**Independent Test Criteria:**
- New chapter is accessible through the documentation site
- Chapter follows the same markdown format with frontmatter
- Sidebar includes the new chapter
- Chapter content is technically accurate and comprehensive

**Tasks:**
- [ ] T105 [US2] Create hri.md file with proper frontmatter following existing template
- [ ] T106 [US2] Write introduction section for Human-Robot Interaction chapter
- [ ] T107 [US2] Write content on perception for human-robot interaction
- [ ] T108 [US2] Write about communication modalities (speech, gesture, etc.)
- [ ] T109 [US2] Write about social robotics principles
- [ ] T110 [US2] Include practical implementation examples with code
- [ ] T111 [US2] Write about ethical considerations in HRI
- [ ] T112 [US2] Add case studies of successful HRI implementations
- [ ] T113 [US2] Include exercises and summary sections
- [ ] T114 [US2] Update sidebars.js to include the new chapter with appropriate categorization

## Phase 5: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
- [ ] T115 Update footer links in docusaurus.config.js to include new chapters
- [ ] T116 Review all chapters for consistency in style and formatting
- [ ] T117 Test the documentation site with all 5 chapters
- [ ] T118 Verify navigation works correctly between all chapters
- [ ] T119 Update any overview sections that reference chapter count
- [ ] T120 Final review and proofreading of all 5 chapters
